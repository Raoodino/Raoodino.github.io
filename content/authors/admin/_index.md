<div style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif; text-align: justify;">
    <p>I am Jeri, a master student at CMU. My research interests include the intersection of information technology and education, innovation, public policy, healthcare.</p>
    <p>The transition from aspiring software engineer to a researcher interested in AI and education was sparked by the integration of AI tools like ChatGPT in our coursework. This shift was further solidified by my role as a teaching assistant for core Information Systems courses, prompting me to delve deeper into the role of AI tools in education.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am conducting research about Social Good and Learning Analytics at Heinz College.</p>
    <p>My avatar was taken in December 2023 in Airport Mesa, Sedona, Arizona, by my friend <a href="https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/cw80" style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;">Dr. Chenyang Wang</a></p>
