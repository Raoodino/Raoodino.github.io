    <p>I am Jeri, my Chinese Name is 饶家瑞, with pronunciation: <span style="color: #FF5733;">ráo jiā ruì</span>. I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Systems Management at <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College</a>, with an expected graduation in May 2024. My academic journey is enriched by courses in programming, digital business, and data analysis. As a socially conscious individual, I am deeply fascinated by the potential synergy between information technology and critical sectors like education, digital economy, public policy, and healthcare.</p>
    <p>I earned my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://english.bnu.edu.cn/">Beijing Normal University （北京师范大学）</a> in 2022, a prestigious institution ranked <span style="color: #FF5733;">#36 in US News Global Best Universities</span> for <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/china/education-educational-research">Education and Educational Research</a>. My major in <span style="color: #4CAF50;">Management Science</span> included core courses such as <span style="color: #FFC107;">Stochastic Process</span>, <span style="color: #FFC107;">Operation Research</span>, and <span style="color: #FFC107;">Time Series Analysis</span>, part of a joint program between the <span style="color: #03A9F4;">School of Systems Science</span> and the <span style="color: #03A9F4;">School of Government</span>. This unique combination provided me with a comprehensive understanding of finance and management. I also minored in <span style="color: #9C27B0;">English Literature</span>, with <span style="color: #E91E63;">Creative Writing</span>, taught by <a href="https://ecs.princeton.edu/people/adeline-heck/">Dr. Adeline Heck</a>, being my favorite course.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The transition from an aspiring software engineer to a researcher was ignited by the integration of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, into our coursework. My engagement deepened through my role as a teaching assistant for Database Management and Distributed Systems courses at CMU, encouraging me to explore the impact of AI in education and the influence of computer science education on students from non-CS backgrounds. Having friends who are educators across China and my experience as a Teach For China volunteer have destined me to pursue pedagogy-related research passionately.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently, I am actively pursuing research opportunities in AI and education, computer science education, as well as learning science and technology. With a wealth of industry and teaching experiences under my belt, coupled with a robust academic foundation and technical proficiency, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your research team.</p>
