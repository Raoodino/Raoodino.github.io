    <p>I am Jeri, my Chinese Name is È•∂ÂÆ∂Áëû, with pronunciation: <span style="color: #EAB676;">r√°o jiƒÅ ru√¨</span>. I am currently pursuing a Master of <span style="color: #DB6987;">Information Systems Management</span> at <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College</a>, a prestigious college ranked <span style="color: #E5E448;"> #1 </span> in Information and Technology Management.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am conducting research on <span style="color: #E98EBB;">Artificial Intelligence in Education</span> focus on LLM and recommendation systems, under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jiognhaolin/home?authuser=0">Dr.Jionghao Lin</a> in US No.1 <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>, to enhance the development of <a href="https://www.tutors.plus/en/">PLUS</a> program.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The transition from an aspiring <span style="color: #21CE9D;">software engineer</span> to a <span style="color: #21CE9D;">researcher</span> was ignited by the integration of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, into our coursework. My engagement deepened through my role as a teaching assistant for graduate courses at CMU, encouraging me to explore the impact of AI in education. Also, I am interested in how computer science education influence students from non-CS backgrounds like me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I earned my undergraduate degree in <span style="color: #DB6987;">Management Science</span>  from <a href="https://english.bnu.edu.cn/">Beijing Normal University ÔºàÂåó‰∫¨Â∏àËåÉÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ôºâ</a> in 2022, a prestigious institution ranked <span style="color: #FF5733;">#36</span> in US News Global Best Universities</span> for <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/china/education-educational-research">Education and Educational Research</a>. I minored in <span style="color: #DB8469;">English Literature</span>, with <span style="color: #4897E5;">Creative Writing</span>, taught by <a href="https://ecs.princeton.edu/people/adeline-heck/">Dr. Adeline Heck</a>, being my favorite course.Here at CMU, my academic journey is enriched by courses in programming, digital business, and data analysis. As a socially conscious individual, I am deeply fascinated by the potential synergy between information technology and critical sectors like education, digital economy, public policy, and healthcare. I also had the honor to work on research in machine learning and social good topics under the guidance of professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu">Woody Zhu</a>.</p>
    <br>
     <p>I am pursuing 2025 Fall doctoral degree opportunities in <span style="color: #E98EBB;">AI and education</span>,  <span style="color: #E9BC8E;">learning science and technology</span> and <span style="color: #8EE98F;">computer science education</span>,<span>information science</span>, . With a wealth of industry and teaching experiences under my belt, coupled with a robust academic foundation and technical proficiency, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your research team.</p>
